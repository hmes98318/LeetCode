## [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

### You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
### You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
### Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.


Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```


## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < prices.size() ; i++){ // 一一比對最佳利潤(暴力破解)
            for(int j = i+1 ; j < prices.size() ; j++){
                maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[j] - prices[i]);
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0, minPrice(INT_MAX); // 設置最小價格
        
        for(auto price : prices){
            minPrice = min(minPrice, price); // 找出 prices 中最小價格
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, price - minPrice); // 再由 price 減去最小價格, 藉此找出最大利潤
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```
