## [2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations/)

### There is a programming language with only `four` operations and `one` variable `X`:
 * `++X` and `X++` increments the value of the variable `X` by `1`.
 * `--X` and `X--` decrements the value of the variable `X` by `1`.
### Initially, the value of `X` is `0`.
### Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return the final value of `X` after performing all the operations.


Example 1:
```
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.
```


## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
        int res = 0;
        
        for(auto str : operations){ // 遍歷整個 operations
            if(str == "--X" || str == "X--") // str 為 --X 或 X-- 時, res--
                res--;
            if(str == "++X" || str == "X++") // str 為 ++X 或 X++ 時, res++
                res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
        int res = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < operations.size(); i++){
            operations[i][1] == '+' ? res++ : res--; // 因為 ++X 或 X++ 在 [1] 的位置都是 +, 所以可以用這個位置來判斷
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Tips :

[`x ? y : z`](https://shengyu7697.github.io/cpp-ternary-operator/) : 三元運算子, 當 x 為 true 時, 回傳 y, 為 false 時, 回傳 z
