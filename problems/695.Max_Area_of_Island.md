## [695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island)

### You are given an `m` x `n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected `4-directionally` (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
### The `area` of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.
### Return the maximum `area` of an island in `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.


#### Example 1:
![iimage](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```


## Solution

### C++  
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, int count){
        if(i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] != 1)
            return count;

        grid[i][j] = 0;
        count++;
        count = search(grid, i+1, j, count);
        count = search(grid, i, j+1, count);
        count = search(grid, i-1, j, count);
        count = search(grid, i, j-1, count);

        return count;
    }

    int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int maxIsland = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++){
                maxIsland = max(maxIsland, search(grid, i, j, 0));
            }
        }

        return maxIsland;
    }
};
```
